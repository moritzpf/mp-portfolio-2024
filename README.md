# Moritz Pfeffer - Portfolio 2024

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio ðŸ‘€

- This project uses Wordpress as a headless CMS. The data is fetched using the [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) plugin
- The frontend is built with [ðŸš€ Astro](https://astro.build)
- The Wordpress Theme is automatically being built by [ðŸš€ Astro](https://astro.build)
- It utilizes [â¬œ ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) for custom fields and Gutenberg blocks
- By defining a new block with all the attributes inside the WordpressBlocks.ts, the block is automatically being created in the Wordpress Theme
- I dont have to write any PHP code, everything is being generated by the Astro CLI. This is a huge time saver and makes the development process much more enjoyable
- Dont know if anyone does it like this, and that may be for a reason, but I like it because it lets me focus on the frontend and not worry about Wordpress too much
